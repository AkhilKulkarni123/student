    "# Reflecting on AP CSP and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "AP CSP gave me a solid foundation in computational thinking and computing's societal impact, but I'm eager to explore much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming Languages\n",
    "I want to expand beyond our classroom basics (JavaScript and Python). Python is my top priority for data science, AI, and automation. Java interests me for AP CSA, enterprise software, and Android development. Eventually, I'd like to learn C++ or Rust for memory management and performance-focused programming, plus SQL for database interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Skills\n",
    "I want to deepen my web development skills beyond basic HTML/CSS by learning frameworks like React or Vue and building full-stack applications. Understanding data structures and algorithms—trees, graphs, hash tables, Big O notation—will help me write efficient code and prepare for technical interviews. I'm also drawn to cybersecurity: penetration testing, secure coding practices, and common vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Soft Skills\n",
    "I need to master Git/GitHub workflows, including branching and merge conflicts. I also want to improve at breaking down projects, estimating timelines, and writing clear documentation. My debugging approach needs work—I tend to make random changes rather than using systematic strategies and proper debugging tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specialized Topics\n",
    "Machine learning and AI fascinate me, especially building systems responsibly given the ethical concerns we discussed. Mobile app development (native or cross-platform) appeals to me since phones are how most people interact with technology. I'm also curious about hardware and embedded systems through projects with Arduino or Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "CS is vast and overwhelming, but that's what makes it exciting. My plan is to focus deeply on one or two areas rather than spreading myself too thin."

    "# Main Achievments/Accomplishments and Learning Objectives Completed in AP CSP Trimester 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Major Learnings and Accomplishments in AP CSP\n",
    "\n",
    "This year in AP CSP, I've developed real-world skills that professional developers actually use, moving far beyond basic syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repository Architecture and File Structure\n",
    "I learned how projects are actually organized: `/src` for source code, `/docs` for documentation, `/public` for static resources, with config files at the root. Understanding files like `package.json` (dependencies and scripts), `.gitignore` (what Git shouldn't track), and `.env` (environment variables) was crucial. The biggest breakthrough was seeing how files connect—how components import utilities, how modules export and import between each other. It's an ecosystem where everything has purpose and relationships, not just isolated files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Git and Development Workflow\n",
    "Beyond basic commands, I learned:\n",
    "- `git branch`, `git checkout -b`, `git merge` (and handling merge conflicts)\n",
    "- `git pull` vs `git fetch`, `git log`, `git status`\n",
    "- `git reset` and `git revert` for fixing mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "I also learned to quickly spin up local servers with `npm start` or `python -m http.server`, find localhost addresses, and test on mobile devices using my local IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Styling and Customization\n",
    "Learning to change website themes taught me CSS architecture and design systems: modifying CSS variables for global changes, understanding specificity and the cascade, working with framework theming, and using browser dev tools to test changes. This taught me about maintainable code—good theme systems let you change an entire site's look by modifying just a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scrum Master Experience\n",
    "Being Scrum Master taught me non-coding skills essential to software development: facilitating stand-ups, maintaining sprint backlogs, removing blockers, running retrospectives, and balancing support with keeping the team on track. I developed communication, organization, conflict resolution, and empathy—understanding that building software is a team sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pull Requests and Code Review\n",
    "Making PRs taught me professional workflows: writing clear descriptions, referencing issues, responding constructively to feedback, and keeping PRs focused and small. This taught me that code isn't just about working—it's about being understandable, maintainable, and reviewable by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It All Connects\n",
    "These skills interconnect: repository architecture helps me make better PRs, Git commands let me manage feature branches, server setup lets me test locally, and being Scrum Master showed me why these practices exist. These are actual professional development practices, and having hands-on experience as a high school student feels like a huge head start. When I interview for internships, I can discuss real collaboration, version control, project management, and team dynamics—not just \"I know how to code.\"\n"
